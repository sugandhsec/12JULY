Python has a built in package called json, which is used to work with json data.
—
dumps(data) – This is used to convert python object into json string.
Example:-
To use json package First we have to import it. import json
python_data = {'name': 'Sonam', 'roll':101 }
json_data = json.dumps(python_data)
print(json_data)
{"name":"Sonam”, “roll": 101}
